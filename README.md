# sas-omi
DSL Proof of Concept for working with SAS metadata. For more information consult the [wiki](https://github.com/tkaszuba/consulting/wiki/SAS-Open-Metadata-Interface-(OMI))

**NOTE:** SAS OMI libraries are not checked in since a SAS/Connect liscence is required hence the code will not compile.
